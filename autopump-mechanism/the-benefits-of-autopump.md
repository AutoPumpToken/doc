# 🛫 The Benefits of AutoPump

It's a self-fueling engine designed to thrive. With the burn and boost approach, AutoPump is hard-coded for ascent, making it a standout choice for those looking for a token that's geared to grow.

* **Programmed to Pump:** AutoPump is designed with a mission - to keep climbing. By automatically buying back and burning tokens, the supply decreases, and potentially, the value per token goes up.
* **Hands-Free:** The entire process runs on smart contracts. Once set, it’s all systems go, no manual controls needed.
* **Consistent Burn:** Each AutoPump event reduces the number of tokens, aiming to boost the value of the remaining ones.
* **Isolated risk architecture:** Embracing two decentralized exchanges reduces the risk of smart contract exploit commonly associated with automated market makers. This also increases arbitrage opportunities for traders on a semi-randomized basis.
* **Semi-randomized pump and liquify:** Utilizing a simple and cost-effective reliance on timestamps for the pump mechanism enables holders to pump prices on a specific decentralized exchange. This encourages more interaction and quicker pump activation while providing arbitrage opportunities for traders.
